  # RSpec Rails uses metadata to mix in different behaviours to your tests,
  # for example enabling you to call `get` and `post` in request specs. e.g.:
  #
  #     RSpec.describe UsersController, type: :request do
  #       # ...
  #     end
  #
  # The different available types are documented in the features, such as in
  # https://rspec.info/features/7-1/rspec-rails
  #
  # You can also this infer these behaviours automatically by location, e.g.
  # /spec/models would pull in the same behaviour as `type: :model` but this
  # behaviour is considered legacy and will be removed in a future version.
  #
  # To enable this behaviour uncomment the line below.
  # config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!
