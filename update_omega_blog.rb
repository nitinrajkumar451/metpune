## 🤝 Working with AI as a Thought Partner: A Reflection

Throughout the development of *Metathon*, I approached AI not just as a code generator but as a strategic collaborator. Here's a breakdown of how the interaction shaped the development journey:

### 🧠 Strategic Planning and Ideation

From the outset, I used AI to refine the vision: building a system that could automate evaluation, extract key metadata from hackathon submissions, and generate meaningful content — blogs, press releases, and insights. This co-planning phase helped turn abstract goals into actionable components.

### 🛠️ Building in Layers: Modular and Test-Driven

I leaned into AI to help me break the system into modules — document ingestion, transcription, evaluation, summarization, and dashboarding. At each stage, I ensured I had:
- Clear prompts for component-specific code
- Test-driven instructions using RSpec
- Database schema guidance
- Route planning and architecture discussions

AI served both as a technical architect and a pair programmer, helping me validate ideas before writing code.

### 🧪 Quality from the Start

I was intentional about quality. With every backend component, I asked for RSpec setup and followed test-first development principles. The goal was to ensure maintainability, especially under tight timelines.

### 🤖 Crafting Prompts as Product Specs

Much of my workflow revolved around designing precise prompts — for both backend logic and AI-generated content. I treated prompt crafting like writing product specs, thinking carefully about:
- What inputs AI should consume (e.g., transcripts, summaries)
- What outputs it should generate (e.g., metadata, trends, blogs)
- How to structure system interactions efficiently (e.g., batching prompts to avoid overload)

### 🔍 Reflective and Adaptive

I constantly questioned decisions: Should I build frontend or backend first? Should I use MVC explicitly? How many prompts can I send in a job? Each time, I used AI to simulate outcomes and adjust my path accordingly.

### 📊 Focused on Delivering Value

The end goal wasn't just to build an app — it was to generate real insight:
- Automatically summarize each team's work
- Identify common challenges and technologies
- Give judges a scalable way to evaluate
- Create content the organization could publish post-event

### 📌 Meta-Learning

The most meta part of *Metathon* was building an app that listens, learns, and summarizes — while working alongside an AI doing the same for me. The process wasn't just AI-powered development — it was AI-reflected development.

*Metathon* wasn't just about submissions and summaries. It was a deep dive into what it feels like to truly co-create with AI. And that, perhaps, was the most rewarding part of all.
