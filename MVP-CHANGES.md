# MVP Simplification: PDF-Only Processing

As part of simplifying the MVP, we've made the following changes to focus on PDF-only document processing with a streamlined approach:

## Key Changes

1. **PDF-Only Support**: 
   - Modified `SUPPORTED_FILE_TYPES` in `IngestDocumentsJob` to only include PDF files
   - Commented out other file types for future implementation
   - Updated processor selection to only handle PDFs

2. **Direct Summarization**:
   - Simplified the processing flow to generate summaries directly from PDF content
   - Removed the two-step approach (extract text + summarize) in favor of a single-step process
   - Added a new `generate_pdf_summary` method in the `Ai::Client` class
   - Updated the `PdfExtractor` to use this new method

3. **Simplified Data Model**:
   - Modified the submission processing to only store the summary
   - Stopped storing raw extracted text separately, as it's not needed for MVP

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Modified the README to clearly indicate PDF-only support in the MVP
   - Added sections for planned future enhancements
   - Updated the AI integration section to reflect the simplified approach

5. **Updated Tests**:
   - Updated existing tests to reflect new simplified approach
   - Added tests for new `generate_pdf_summary` method
   - Added tests for new PDF summary prompt

## Benefits of Simplification

1. **Reduced API Calls**: One AI call per document instead of two
2. **Faster Processing**: Streamlined pipeline with fewer steps
3. **Better Context Preservation**: AI directly processes the whole document
4. **Simpler Data Model**: No need to store raw text separately
5. **Focused MVP**: Clear scope limits make development and deployment faster

## Automated Content Generation

We've added a comprehensive automated content generation system that follows the same simplification principles:

1. **Automated Workflow**:
   - Implemented rake tasks that automatically generate content when prerequisites are available
   - Created a scheduled task system using the `whenever` gem
   - Added a command-line script for manual execution

2. **Content Dependencies**:
   - Team Summaries → Team Blogs → Team Evaluations
   - Each step only proceeds when the previous content is available

3. **Key Features**:
   - `auto_blogs:generate`: Creates blogs for teams with successful summaries
   - `auto_blogs:generate_all`: Creates summaries and blogs for all teams
   - `auto_blogs:evaluate`: Creates evaluations for teams with summaries
   - `bin/generate_content`: Script to run all tasks in sequence

4. **Scheduled Tasks**:
   - 10-minute checks for teams needing blogs
   - 15-minute checks for teams needing summaries
   - 20-minute checks for teams needing evaluations

This automation streamlines the content generation process and ensures a consistent flow from submissions to evaluation without manual intervention.

## Future Extensions

The code has been structured to easily extend to other file types in the future:
- Commented code sections indicate where to add support for new file types
- Tests already include placeholders for future functionality
- Documentation clearly identifies current capabilities vs. future plans

## Testing

All tests have been updated and are passing. The system correctly:
- Downloads PDF files from Google Drive
- Generates summaries directly using the AI service
- Stores only the essential summary information
- Handles error cases appropriately

This simplified approach provides a solid MVP that focuses on the core value proposition while reducing complexity for initial deployment.
