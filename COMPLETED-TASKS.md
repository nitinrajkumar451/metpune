### Testing the Automated Content Generation

To test the automated content generation system:

1. Run the tasks manually:
   ```bash
   # Generate summaries and blogs for all teams
   bundle exec rake auto_blogs:generate_all
   
   # Generate blogs for teams with summaries
   bundle exec rake auto_blogs:generate
   
   # Generate evaluations for teams with summaries
   bundle exec rake auto_blogs:evaluate
   ```

2. Test the command-line script:
   ```bash
   bin/generate_content
   ```

3. Test the scheduled tasks:
   ```bash
   # Add to crontab
   bundle exec whenever --update-crontab metathon
   
   # Check crontab entries
   crontab -l
   
   # Wait for scheduled execution or force a run
   bundle exec rake auto_blogs:generate
   
   # Check the log
   tail -f log/cron.log
   
   # Clear crontab when done
   bundle exec whenever --clear-crontab metathon
   ```
